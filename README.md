# Project: Traveler ptFlex
Following the sunsetting of the PTMini project, the ptFlex is the second generation of the ArduinoTrack APRS tracker.  

The ptFlex is based on the same ATMega processor and much of the same hardware as the ArduinoTrack, but a newer and smaller form factor.  The new form factor removes the larger Arduino Shield connectors that proved to be fragile and rarely used.  Instead, the digial pins have been replaced with a single "Qwiic" connector, conforming to Sparkfun's Qwiic standards.

Board version 1.0.3 is release-candidate level, and is currently undergoing flight testing.
